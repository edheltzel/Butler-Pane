# AGENTS.md

Butler Pane (https://github.com/edheltzel/Butler-Pane): a Tern plugin (Luau) that teaches Tern about GitButler: a status segment, a workspace block, a diff block, command lenses, and actions, all driven by the `but` CLI. Design and findings: `DESIGN.md`. User guide: `README.md`. The plugin id stays `gitbutler`, so command ids remain `plugin.gitbutler.*`.

## DOX

These `AGENTS.md` files are binding work contracts for their subtrees.

- **Before editing:** read this file, then every `AGENTS.md` on the path to each file you will touch (see the Child DOX Index). The closer doc controls local detail; no child may weaken this one. Re-read the chain in the current session; don't rely on memory.
- **After editing:** update the nearest owning `AGENTS.md` when a change affects purpose, structure, contracts, workflows, side effects or user preferences, plus any parent whose index or structure changed. Remove stale text. Small edits that change no contract may leave docs unchanged, but say so.
- **Style:** concise, current, operational. Stable contracts, not history. Broad rules here, concrete detail in children.

## GitButler is mandatory

This repo is a GitButler workspace (`gitbutler/workspace`, target `origin/main`, remote `origin` = github.com/edheltzel/Butler-Pane, public, default branch `main`), and the plugin requires `but` at run time. Work lands on `main` through a PR (`but pr new <branch>`).

- **VCS in this repo:** use `but` for every write: `but commit -b <branch> -m "<msg>" <ids>`, `but push <branch>`, `but pr new <branch>`. Never run `git add`, `commit`, `checkout`, `switch`, `merge`, `rebase`, `reset`, `stash`, `cherry-pick` or `push`. Read-only git (`git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, `git blame`) is fine. Follow `skill://but`.
- If HEAD is ever not `gitbutler/workspace`, stop and ask. Do not work around it with plain git or `but teardown`.
- **Plugin runtime:** `but` (tested with 0.22.3) must be installed on the machine that runs the panes. `gb.luau` looks for it in `PATH`, `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`.
- Never add an agent as a commit co-author.
- **Shipping to `main` (user rule):** every PR goes through the no-mistakes gate, and no-mistakes must follow GitButler (no checkout, no worktree workaround). Only for that ship: `but config push-remote no-mistakes`, `but push <top branch>`, keep the top branch's run and abort the lower ones (`no-mistakes axi abort --run <id>`), then `but config push-remote origin`. One PR per ship.
- **Gate limits on a GitButler workspace:** a push can't carry `--intent`, so the gate infers it from transcripts; and `no-mistakes axi respond` resolves only the current branch, so it can't answer a gate while HEAD is `gitbutler/workspace`. Drive parked gates from the `no-mistakes` TUI.
- **Gate refs need new names to re-push:** `but push` to the gate fails with `Failed to derive forge information` when it must force-push. Rename the branches (`but reword <branch> -m <new-name>`) so they push as new refs.

## Commands

- Link into Tern (reloads on every save): `tern plugin link plugin` (link `plugin/`, never the repo root)
- Status and load errors: `tern plugin list` (host half); window-half errors appear in `~/Library/Logs/Tern/tern.log`
- Force reload: `tern plugin reload`
- Regenerate types after a Tern upgrade: `tern plugin types plugin` (writes `plugin/tern.d.luau`; don't hand-edit it)
- Parser check: `cd plugin && luau check.luau` (must print `parse: ok`)
- Syntax check: `cd plugin && luau-analyze host.luau lenses.luau gb.luau window.luau parse.luau 2>&1 | grep -i syntax` (empty output means clean; the type errors it reports are expected noise, because luau-lsp/luau-analyze can't load `tern.d.luau`)
- CI: `.no-mistakes.yaml` owns the checks (`commands.test` = parser check, `commands.lint` = syntax check over every `.luau` except `tern.d.luau`, failing on any `SyntaxError` or a missing/crashed `luau-analyze`); `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirrors them on Luau 0.741 (regenerate with `no-mistakes ci-workflow -f`, then restore the Install Luau step). The gate reads `commands.*` only from `main`.
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/Tern/tern-daemon.log` (host half, `plugin handler failed`), `~/Library/Logs/Tern/tern.log` (window half)

## Testing

Run tests in the scratch repo and an isolated Tern, never in real repos.

- Sandbox repo (recreate if `/tmp` was cleared):
  `mkdir -p /tmp/gbs && cd /tmp/gbs && git init -q --bare remote.git && git init -q -b main work && cd work && echo hi > a.txt && git add . && git commit -qm initial && git remote add origin /tmp/gbs/remote.git && git push -q -u origin main && but setup`
  (Plain git is allowed here only to seed the scratch repo before `but setup`.)
- Isolated Tern: `printf '{"shell":"/opt/homebrew/bin/fish","status_bar":true}\n' > /tmp/ttc/settings.json`, `TERN_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/ttc tern plugin link plugin`, then from `/tmp/ttc` run `TERN_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/ttc TERN_DAEMON_SOCKET=/tmp/ttc/daemon.sock tern --control /tmp/ttc/ctl.sock /tmp/gbs/work` (long-running).
- **Never override `HOME`** (no fake home dirs). Tern's sign-in lives under the real home, so a fresh home opens Tern's closed-beta sign-in screen and loads no plugins. Isolate with `TERN_CONFIG_DIR`, `TERN_DAEMON_SOCKET` and `--control` only, as above. This applies to no-mistakes test agents too.
- Drive it with `TERN_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/ttc TERN_DAEMON_SOCKET=/tmp/ttc/daemon.sock`:
  - `tern ls`
  - `tern send <pane> keys enter` / `tern send <pane> text c`
  - `timeout 8 tern ctl --control /tmp/ttc/ctl.sock plugins run plugin.gitbutler.open`
  - `timeout 8 tern ctl --control /tmp/ttc/ctl.sock shot NAME` (writes `/tmp/ttc/target/shots/tern/live/NAME.png`)
- Verify each mutation with `but status --json` in `/tmp/gbs/work`.
- Lenses only appear in shells spawned after the plugin loaded (they need the spawn env) and with Tern's shell integration. `tern new tab` from the CLI starts the login shell (bash here), which shows plain output; test lenses in a tab Tern opens with its configured shell (fish).
- The status bar is off unless `"status_bar": true` is in `settings.json`, and the setting takes effect only after Tern restarts.
- fish may pre-fill the prompt (`$EDITOR`): send `ctrl+u` before `tern run <pane> <command>`.
- After ⏎ opens a diff, focus returns to the workspace block, so keys sent to the workspace pane never reach the diff.

## Gotchas

- Saving any file under `plugin/` reloads every plugin in the user's real Tern as well as the test window. A reload that fails mid-edit kills open blocks; reopen them.
- Tern watches the linked package recursively, and `.git` writes count as changes (measured: each one reloads every plugin). That is why the package lives in `plugin/` with `.git` at the repo root. Never move plugin files to the root or link the root, or every `but` call in this repo will reload Tern's plugins.
- `tern ctl wait` and `tern ctl type` can hang: wrap `ctl` calls in `timeout`, and use `tern send` for keys.
- A plugin reload does not emit `window_start`/`focus`. Window state is re-bootstrapped with `tern.timer(0, …)`.
- `but` 0.22.3 cannot assign an uncommitted file to a branch without committing it (`rub` is retired). See `DESIGN.md`.
- CLI ids (`nk`, `ymn`, `zn:n`) are snapshot-local. Don't hold them across a refresh for a later mutation.
- `but tui` and `but gui` are real commands; the plugin opens `but tui` in a floated pane and `but gui` as the desktop app. Tern picks a float's size; the plugin API can't set it.
- `but` 0.22.3 has no `but init`. `but setup --init` creates the git repo (empty commit) when there is none, then sets GitButler up; the plugin's "Set up this folder" command runs it.

## Boundaries

- **Never:** raw git writes (see above), mutating a real repo while testing, editing `tern.d.luau` by hand, or editing `CHANGELOG.md` or other generated files.
- **Ask first:** new `[[lenses]]` match patterns (a claim also blocks Tern's built-in lens), changes to the spawn filter (it affects every shell Tern starts), new default keybinds, and adding a remote or changing the `origin/main` target.

## User Preferences

- Shipping goes through no-mistakes on top of GitButler, one PR per ship (see GitButler section).
- GitButler's push remote is `origin` except while shipping to `main`.

## Child DOX Index

- `plugin/AGENTS.md`: the Tern package: file ownership, architecture boundaries (budgets, `but`-only writes, half separation), Luau coding standards, verification commands
- `regroup/AGENTS.md`: dated status check-ins, append-only

Owned here (no child doc): `DESIGN.md` (surfaces, JSON fields relied on, action → command map, findings), `README.md` (user tutorial).
