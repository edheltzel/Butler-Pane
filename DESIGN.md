# Tern × GitButler: design note

Plugin id `gitbutler`. See the README prerequisites for the currently tested Tern and GitButler CLI versions.

Runtime files live in `plugin/`, the linked package; `plugin/AGENTS.md` owns the file map. `.git` stays at the repo root because Tern reloads plugins on any change inside the package.

## Is this folder GitButler-managed?

One function, `gb.root(path)` in `gb.luau`, required by both halves:

1. Walk up from `path` to the first `.git`. A `.git` file (a linked worktree) is followed through `gitdir:`, then `commondir`.
2. Managed when `<gitdir>/HEAD` is `ref: refs/heads/gitbutler/…` (`workspace`, or `edit` during `but resolve`) **and** `<commondir>/gitbutler/` exists.
3. Return the worktree root, or `nil`.

The check only stats and reads files, with no process, so it is cheap enough for window handlers (50 ms budget) and fits inside the 2 s host budget. It turns false after `but teardown`, because HEAD leaves `gitbutler/`. Every surface calls it.

It answers "must raw git stay out?", not "does `but` know this project?". `Atlas/Iris`, `GAT/Card2` and `Websites/SIGsite` are on `gitbutler/workspace` but missing from but's project list, so `but status --json` returns `{"error":"setup_required"}`. For those repos the segment reads `GitButler: run but setup`, and the block shows the error.

## Surfaces

| Need | Tern surface | Half |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status segment (applied branches, unpushed commits) | `tern.chrome.status` reads a cache. `focus`/`cwd`/`command_finished` events and a 30 s timer refresh it with an async `but status --json`. `command_finished` re-probes the focused cwd at once, then every other pane cwd in `tern.timer(0)` chunks of about 10 ms (a newer command supersedes an older sweep), overwriting cache entries in place and refreshing chrome when one changed, then drops entries no pane uses. So a segment drops after `but teardown` even in an unfocused pane, a child cwd picks up `but setup`, other repos keep their segment, and the handler stays inside the 50 ms window budget | window |
| Workspace block (lanes, uncommitted files, assignments, actions) | `[[blocks]] workspace`. Polls with `tern.process.run` (review-queue pattern), `r` refreshes. Four views over the same rows and cursor, so every action works in each: `lanes` (cards per stack, the default), `graph` (branch pills, a CSS lane per stack joined at the base, the selected commit's detail beside it), `stacks` (uncommitted tray, one column per stack, commit cards) and `branches` (sidebar of branches by stack, the selected branch's commits and files). `v` cycles them (palette: "Switch workspace view"); the choice is stored in `tern.kv` (`view`) for new blocks. The new views draw `el` nodes styled by `styles.css` (manifest `styles`, scoped to `[data-surface="plugin.gitbutler.workspace"]`; Tern CSS has no `ch` unit, so widths use `var(--sf-cw)`). Each view walks only the rows it shows, clicks select (`pick=<key>`) and double-clicks open the diff, and since `main` never scrolls each shows a window of rows around the cursor. Side-by-side versus stacked layout is CSS `flex-wrap`, not `cx.cols`: the block's reported size can lag its pane | host |
| File/commit diff view | `[[blocks]] diff`. The workspace block calls `cx:open("gitbutler://diff?…")`, and `tern.route.link` in the window turns that into `cx:new_block("gitbutler.diff", …, "beside")` | host + window |
| `but status/diff/show/oplog` in a shell | `[[lenses]]`. JSON output is parsed when the command was run with `--json`. Otherwise `parse.luau` reads the human text (your call, lenses only). A `spawn` filter gives new shells `BUT_THEME=dark` and `BUT_PAGER=cat` unless the spawn spec already carries them (the daemon's own environment is not what shells receive, so it is not consulted). Without them, `but` sends OSC 10/11 color queries and DA1, and its `less` pager turns on keypad mode, and Tern aborts any capture that does that, so no lens could ever render | host |
| Open the workspace from a git action | `tern.override("new_git_block")`: GitButler repo → workspace block, else `false` (Tern's git block) | window |
| Palette and keys | `tern.command` + `keys` (⌥⇧⌘G open, ⌥⇧⌘C commit, ⌥⇧⌘A absorb, ⌥⇧⌘Z undo, ⌥⇧⌘P push, plus unbound rows for the rest). A command opens or focuses a live block (an ended plugin pane has no surface, so a new one is opened), then sends it `{ev="action", act=…}` through `cx.session:event`, so the action runs on the block's selection with the block's confirmations | window |
| `but tui` and `but gui` | Unbound palette commands. Tui splits the focused pane with a shell running `but tui` in the workspace root, `cx.layout:float`s it as picture-in-picture (Tern picks the float size; the API has none), then focuses it, since floating hands focus back to the pane underneath. One tui per workspace root: a rerun focuses the live pane; once it has quit, a new one opens. Gui runs `but gui` through `gb.run` and toasts on failure | window |
| Set up a folder (`but setup`) | Unbound palette command "GitButler: Set up this folder". `but` 0.22.3 has no `but init`; this runs `but setup --init` in the focused pane's cwd, which creates the git repo (empty commit) only when there is none, then registers it and switches to `gitbutler/workspace`. Refuses `$HOME` and `/`, toasts "Already a GitButler workspace" when `gb.root` already matches, and on success re-probes that cwd and refreshes chrome so the segment appears at once | window |
| Raw git block opened on a GitButler repo | `git.*` are view chords, so they can't be overridden (`tern.override` takes only command ids). `pane_created`/`focus` check `cx.session:pane(id)` for `kind = "git"`, run `gb.root(path)`, and toast a warning once per pane | window |

Programmatic `gb.run` calls are async (`tern.process.run` with `timeout_ms`), use `-C <root>`, get empty stdin, and set `NO_COLOR=1`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`. State reads and mutations pass `--json`; the `but gui` launcher is the exception because it returns no model. `but tui` instead starts an interactive shell command in the workspace root. Each block allows one mutation at a time. Reads and `but gui` time out after 15 s, ordinary mutations after 60 s, and push, PR, land and pull after 120 s.

## JSON fields relied on

- `but status -f --json`: `uncommittedChanges[]{cliId,filePath,changeType}`, `stacks[]{cliId,assignedChanges[],branches[]{cliId,name,branchStatus,reviewId,commits[]{cliId,changeId,commitId,message,conflicted,changes[]{cliId,filePath,changeType}},upstreamCommits[]}}`, `upstreamState.behind`, `mergeBase.commitId`. Mutations pass `zz:<path>`, a full `changeId`, or `<changeId>:<path>`, not the snapshot `cliId`.
- `branchStatus`: `completelyUnpushed` means every commit is unpushed, and `nothingToPush` means 0. For `unpushedCommits*`, the segment asks `but push --dry-run --json` for `branches[]{branchName,unpushedCommits}`.
- `but push --dry-run --json` (untargeted; `but push <branch> --dry-run` reports only that branch): `branches[]{branchName,unpushedCommits,requiresForce}`. Push and PR read status first and are danger when the selected branch or any branch below it in that fresh stack (top-first) has `requiresForce`, or the field is present but not a boolean, or either read fails, or the branch is missing from status. A branch the dry-run omits has nothing to push.
- `but diff <id> --json`: `changes[]{path,status,diff{type,hunks[]{diff}}}`. The hunks are joined into unified text for `tern.ui.diff`.
- `but oplog list --json`: `[]{id,createdAt(ms),details{operation,title,body}}`.
- `but pull --check --json`: `upToDate`, `upstreamCommits.count`, `baseBranch.name`, `hasWorktreeConflicts`, `branchStatuses[]{name,status}` (`status == "conflicted"` means pulling leaves that branch's commits conflicted). A reply missing or mistyping any of these stops the pull.
- `but branch list --local --empty --all --no-check --json`: `branches[]{name,commitsAhead}` (unapplied branches, including empty ones, for apply). `--no-check` skips the per-branch mergeability check the picker never shows.
- Mutation results (`commit`, `absorb`, `undo`, …) are checked by exit status. JSON is used only for messages.

## Action → command

| Action | Command | Confirm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commit marked/selected files to a branch | `but commit -b <branch> -m <msg> [zz:<path>…]` | no for a name a fresh status read shows is not in a stack, or when that branch and every branch stacked above it are `completelyUnpushed`; a failed read does not take the no-confirm path (danger). Otherwise danger (push state re-read before deciding) |
| Move uncommitted file to branch | `but amend -t <branch> zz:<path>` (amends the branch tip) | yes; danger when that branch or one stacked above it is not `completelyUnpushed` (push state re-read before the confirm) |
| Move committed file / commit to branch | `but move <changeId> -b <branch>` (a file is `<changeId>:<path>`) | yes; danger when either branch, or one stacked above it, is not `completelyUnpushed` (push state re-read before the confirm) |
| Absorb | `but absorb [zz:<path>]`; the sheet shows `but absorb --dry-run --json` first | yes; danger when a target commit's branch, or one stacked above it, is not `completelyUnpushed` (push state re-read before the confirm). On y/Enter the dry-run is repeated; if commit targets or files differ, it aborts and shows the new plan (push state re-checked) |
| Reword commit / rename branch | `but reword <changeId or branch name> -m <text>` | danger when the commit's branch or one stacked above it is not `completelyUnpushed` (rename checks only the renamed branch; push state re-read before acting); otherwise no |
| New branch (parallel / stacked) | `but branch new <name> [-A <branch>]` | no |
| Apply / unapply | `but apply <name>` / `but unapply <name>` | unapply: yes |
| Undo / restore oplog entry | `but undo` (aborts if the oplog head is no longer the confirmed entry) / `but oplog restore <sha>` | yes |
| Push / PR / land | `but push <branch>` / `but pr new <branch> -t` / `but land <branch> --yes` | yes. Push and PR are danger (`y` only) when a fresh status plus an untargeted dry-run says the branch or one below it requires force, or either read fails or the branch is missing, and the sheet says it will force-push; otherwise Enter confirms. Land is always danger |
| Pull upstream (`f`) | `but pull --check --json`, then `but pull` | none when `upToDate` (notice only); an unexpected `--check` reply is an error, not a confirm. Otherwise danger: it fetches and rebases every applied branch onto the target; the sheet names the new commit count, the branches that will end up conflicted, and worktree conflicts, and the result notice names the conflicted branches |

Marks are file paths, captured before an async file check. Escape cancels a pending action read (the shared read drops its callback) as well as clearing marks. If a marked path is no longer an uncommitted change, the action stops and those marks are cleared; it does not commit every change. Targeted file actions refuse names containing `:` because but 0.22 interprets them as selector separators and may target another file or hunk. Polling pauses while a sheet is open so a refresh cannot retarget it. An anonymous stack still has only a snapshot CLI id; unapply re-reads status and aborts if that id now labels different commits. Undo re-reads the oplog head and aborts if it moved, because restoring that snapshot would also revert later operations. Oplog restore runs `but oplog restore` on the sha the sheet confirmed. Confirm and pick sheets take only unmodified keys (no shift, ctrl, alt, or meta) and never a paste. A prompt still accepts paste and shift+enter; other ctrl, alt, and meta chords are ignored. Escape cancels every sheet. Confirm commands use POSIX single quotes around any argument that is not a plain token, so the line is paste-safe.

## Open questions / findings

1. **There is no CLI assignment in but 0.22.3.** `but rub` is retired, `move`/`squash` reject uncommitted sources ("Cannot pass uncommitted file or hunk as source"), and the TUI has no assign step either. The block shows `assignedChanges` (set by the GUI) read-only. `m` on an uncommitted file amends it into the chosen branch's tip, or commits it there when the branch is empty. `m` on a commit or committed file runs `but move`.
2. **Lenses vs JSON-only:** decided. Lenses parse human text and use JSON when `--json` was typed. Human status output carries push state only as color, so plain `but status` shows no pushed/unpushed badge. `but status --json` does. The status lens treats a dated `(sha …)` commit line as a two-line verbose header only when the command carried `-v`/`--verbose` (including grouped flags like `-fv`); compact subjects are free text.
3. **Remote hosts:** the status segment runs `but` on the desktop. Panes on a remote host get no segment, but the block still works, since it runs where the panes run.
4. **Unpushed counts for partially pushed branches** come from `push --dry-run`. If it omits a branch, the segment shows `N+`.
5. **`BUT_THEME=dark`** is a fixed default. On a light theme, export `BUT_THEME=light` in your shell rc. The rc runs after the spawn env, so it wins.
